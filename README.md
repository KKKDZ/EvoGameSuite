# Introduction

**EvoGameSuite** is a gamified testing platform that evaluate your manually written tests against those generated by EvoSuite. The goal is to compare the quality and effectiveness of both test suites in achieving high mutation coverage using PIT. This project is built with Spring Boot, Maven, EvoSuite, and PIT, and is designed to run exclusively on Java 8.

# How It Works

**Test Configuration:**
  Choose a class from the available list and configure the test generation (either using predefined settings or manually).

**View Source:**
  A button allows you to view the source code of the selected class, making it easy to verify what you’re testing.

**Test Execution:**
  After configuring and writing your tests, the application runs EvoSuite and PIT, compares the mutation coverage, and assigns points based on:
    +10 points per mutant killed
    -1 point per mutant surviving (including those with no coverage)
    A bonus of +20 points to the test suite with higher coverage

**Results:**
  Detailed results are shown, including mutation score and line coverage for both your tests and EvoSuite’s tests.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Java 8**
  Ensure you have Java 8 installed *(unless using Docker - the dockerfile deploys an openjdk 1.8 by default)*. If multiple JDKs are installed, set JAVA_HOME accordingly.
  
- **Maven Wrapper**
  The project includes the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so you don't need a separate Maven installation.

- **Docker** (Recommended) 
  To guarantee a consistent environment, you can run the project inside a Docker container.

## Running with Docker (Recommended)

Using Docker ensures that the project always runs on Java 8 with all required dependencies.

1. **Build the Docker image:**

   docker build --no-cache -t evogamesuite .

2. **Run the Docker image:**

   docker run -p 8080:8080 evogamesuite

2. **Access the application:**

   Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/game/start

## Running Natively (Not Recommended)

If you prefer to run the project directly on your machine, make sure to set up Java 8 correctly.

**Set JAVA_HOME (Linux example):**
  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk
  export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

**Build and run the application using the Maven Wrapper:**
  ./mvnw clean package
  ./mvnw spring-boot:run

**Access the application:**
  Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/game/start
